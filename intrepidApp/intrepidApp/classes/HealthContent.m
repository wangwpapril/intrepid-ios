In some benign cases, especially in children, the symptoms resemble that of gastroenteritis. Most often, the toxic infection (Infection due to a bacteria-secreting a toxin) is characterized by very abundant, watery stools, sometimes with blood, accompanied by vomiting, severe abdominal cramps, and extremely painful muscle cramps. In untreated cases, severe dehydration may be followed by circulatory collapse (Blood pressure drop) - with a fatality rate of 50 percent. However, when cholera is treated with an appropriate antibiotic and fluid therapy, mortality is 1 to 5 percent." details:@"Cholera is usually spread by the ingestion of contaminated water or food, especially raw or undercooked shellfish and fish. It is rarely transmitted from person to person. The incubation period varies from a few hours to 3 days (maximum of 7 days). Gastric achlorhydria (marked by the absence of hydrochloric acid and the inability to digest food properly. Can follow the use of certain drugs to treat ulcers) increases a person's vulnerability to the disease. Infected individuals usually become contagious 2 to 3 days before the disease becomes manifest and remain contagious up to 2 weeks after symptoms have subsided. Some people carry the bacteria for several months." common:FALSE symptoms:@"The best preventive measures include avoiding contaminated water and food and washing hands frequently. Cooking foods and boiling water thoroughly will destroy the bacteria. If you think you may be vulnerable consider taking a prophylactic antibiotic, such as doxycycline, cotrimazole, or erythromycin." immunization:@"The cholera vaccine isn't recommended very often in North America, because the infection can be easily avoided if adequate dietary precautions are taken. However, vaccination may be suggested by your physician if you are travelling to an area where the disease is common or during an epidemic or where sanitary conditions are known to be inadequate. Two vaccines are mainly used. The first one is given in a single dose (injection) and is effective in 90% of patients, 8 days after administration. Its protection lasts 6 months. It is not recommended for children less than 6 months of age, and should be avoided when possible in pregnant women. It often causes a reaction at the injection site (redness and pain).The second vaccine is administered orally and was recently marketed under the brand name Dukoral. It also protects against traveler's diarrhea caused by E. coli. It is indicated in adults and children 2 years and older. Patients take 2 or 3 doses, depending on age. Its protection starts approximately 1 week after the last dose and remains effective for 3 months for traveler's diarrhea due to E.coli and 2 years for cholera. The risk of European or North American travellers contracting cholera is so low (1 or 2 cases per 1 million trips to an endemic area) that WHO (World Health Organization) does not recommend the vaccine to travellers."

The following preventive measures should be followed to avoid getting infected: Wash hands before handling food; Wash hands before meals and after using the bathroom; Do not eat or drink beverages and foods that might be contaminated. Exposing the hepatitis A virus to temperatures of at least 85 degree Celsius for 1 minute will inactivate it. The virus can also be inactivated by adding chlorine or iodine to the contaminated water." immunization:@"Since the incidence of hepatitis A is common among travellers and the vaccine is safe, it is recommended that all travellers visiting countries where hepatitis A is rated endemic at a high or intermediate level should be vaccinated. In some countries where sanitary conditions are better, immunization is recommended only for travellers who expect to venture outside regular tourist areas. Those who frequently travel abroad or who stay for long periods of time should always be vaccinated. The vaccine (Havrix) is administered in 2 shots, at 6 to 12 month intervals. The vaccine confers good immunity within 2 to 4 weeks following the first shot. When 2 doses are administered, the vaccine may be effective up to 20 years.The hepatitis A vaccine is also available in combination with a hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix). The combined vaccine is recommended in the presence of hepatitis C, when no hepatitis B antibodies have been found. Immune globulins may also be administered.

The virus is in the same class as the one that causes Japanese encephalitis. It is spread by mosquito bites and is found across the globe. Several bird species constitute its animal reservoir. The virus has been associated with numerous outbreaks in several African, Asian, Middle-Eastern, and European countries. In America, the virus was first observed in late summer 1999 in the New York City area. At that time, 62 cases of encephalitis and 7 deaths were reported. In October 2000, the New York City Department of Health conducted a study in people 5 years and older who lived in the neighborhood where most cases of encephalitis had occurred. The study revealed the presence of antibodies (a sign of exposure to the virus) in 2.6 percent of the population. Most of the affected individuals reported no specific symptoms, other than mild flu-like symptoms. In Canada, the virus was detected for the first time during the summer of 2001. The presence of the virus was later confirmed in birds and mosquitos. Only a few human cases were diagnosed in 2002. Most provinces now have a monitoring system in place. It is estimated that about 20 percent of those infected will develop mild symptoms. Only 1 percent of those infected will develop a severe form of the illness, and most of them will be elderly. In the New York State outbreak, 60 percent of those infected were 65 years or older." details:@"The disease usually has a sudden onset. Patients present with a fever (lasting 3 to 5 days) which is sometimes associated with the following symptoms: severe headaches, skin rash, usually on the abdomen, eye pain, swollen lymph glands, gastrointestinal upset, muscle weakness and muscle pain. The incubation period usually lasts 5 to 15 days. In most cases, the person has no symptoms or suffers from a benign flu-like syndrome. Rarely, and mostly in the elderly, it may cause encephalitis or meningitis, with or without muscle weakness.The West Nile Virus is transmitted to humans and animals by the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus is found in the salivary glands of mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. Several bird species can be infected, including crows, sparrows, and various exotic birds. This is the reason why health authorities in Canada are keeping track of the number of dead birds and are taking blood samples as a means to monitor the virus. The latest data shows that the virus can also be transmitted through blood, organ transplants, pregnancy and breastfeeding. The virus is not transmitted through person to person contact. It is impossible to catch it by kissing an infected person or caring for a person who has the virus. There is no evidence to show that the virus is transmitted from an infected bird or animal to a person. West Nile encephalitis is a seasonal illness because it depends on the presence of mosquitoes. In Canada, outbreaks are more likely to occur during late summer or fall." common:FALSE symptoms:@"In areas with West Nile Virus activity, it is estimated that less than 1 percent of all mosquitoes are infected. Nevertheless, here are a few simple measures to reduce the risk of contracting this virus: Use an insect repellent with DEET - maximum concentration of 30% in adults or 10% in children 2 years or older. In general, children under 2 years should avoid DEET-based insect repellents. In some situations where there is a high risk of complications from an insect bite, it is possible to apply a product with 10% DEET or less, but only once per day for children aged 6 months to 2 years. Avoid using repellent on the hands and face of children because of the risk of mouth or eye contact. Do not apply insect repellent on wounds or broken skin. Always wash repellent-treated skin when coming back indoors. Wear light-coloured clothing with full-length pants and sleeves during outdoor activities. In areas where mosquitoes abound, stay inside at dawn and dusk. Make sure that mosquito screens are not damaged. Reduce the mosquito population around your house by eliminating all sources of standing water and wastes. Do not touch sick or dead birds or animals with your bare hands. While there is still no evidence that WNV can be transmitted in such a way, animals can carry other diseases. If the creature must be handled, wear gloves or use a plastic bag." immunization:@"There is no specific treatment or vaccine against this disease. Evidence suggests a person cannot get West Nile disease more than once; the initial infection appears to confer lifelong immunity. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient's condition. A human vaccine is being developed. Diagnosis is based on a specific blood test. Usually 2 blood samples are drawn 14 to 21 days apart. For monitoring purposes, the presence of the virus is suspected when there is: acute febrile illness. Signs of viral encephalitis. Altered mental state or muscle weakness. No other infectious agent yet identified. This definition excludes cases of viral meningitis not associated with encephalitis.
